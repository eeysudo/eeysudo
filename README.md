# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi there, I'm a developer with 25 years experience, passionate about **data structures, performance-first architecture, and real-world systems** that deliver under pressure. My primary stack includes:

- **Languages**: PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Bash
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis
- **Tooling & Runtime**: Node.js, Apache, Nginx, CLI utilities
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, minimal JS — built for purpose, not fluff
- **Backends & APIs**: RESTful services, lightweight micro-logic, pure-PHP backends when speed matters

---

## 📦 What I Build

I specialize in:
- **Clean, logic-driven systems** — especially in racing analytics, predictive modeling, and form pattern analysis
- **Lean codebases** — I avoid bloated frameworks when raw, sharp code does it better
- **Database-first thinking** — schema design and query efficiency always come before shiny layers
- **Real utility** — everything here is either solving a real problem or pushing a system further

---

## 🔁 Why I Share

Open-source isn’t just about code — it’s about **patterns, pressure-testing, and perspective**.

I publish snippets, prototypes, and modular blocks so others can:
- See how problems get pulled apart at scale
- Build faster with real, proven logic
- Avoid wasted effort by skipping trendy fluff

If you're someone who values **function over form**, **logic over legacy**, and **insight over noise**, you're in the right place.

## 🛠️ Recent Areas of Focus

- Backtesting intelligence
- Collusion & behavioral pattern detection
- Time-series data evaluation
- Efficient CLI tooling and backtest engines
- Traits-based scoring engines with modular logic blocks

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

If you’re building something sharp — especially in **sports intelligence**, **data systems**, or **code performance optimization** — feel free to connect or fork anything here. Most of what I build is designed to be dissected, adapted, and improved.

Built for signal, not noise.
